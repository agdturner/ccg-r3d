                 * have been (without shadow) could be reduced by some factor,
                 * or we can try to account for light emitted from the surface
                 * to provide variable shading. Setting to a default ambient
                 * light colour will typically make for a picture where many
                 * parts have the same murky colour which many viewers might
                 * regard as being unrealistic. Accounting for light emitted
                 * from surfaces is typically computationally demanding and more
                 * so with more surfaces with more concave features. Shading in
                 * a way is infinitely complex! Physics suggests that billions
                 * of photons (packets of energy) are emitted
                 * electromagnetically from light sources that convert mass into
                 * energy. Our vision - our eyes and our brains are geared to
                 * build up a visualisation - what we see. The process is
                 * amazing really and as things move there is a lot of
                 * calculation being done! Modelling this iteratively can help
                 * to generate more realistic images, but at what cost? Even
                 * accounting for first and second order shadows can be so
                 * computationally demanding, there has to be a value judgement
